        <p>I work on OIT's custom app development team. I mainly deal with API's and web applications. Kotlin is
        the primary language used by my team. I use tools such as github, postman, intellij, and WSO2. I work with
        the Agile development process. I've worked on BYU parking, locker rentals, and student voting systems</p>

        <p>I worked with the school's chromebooks and iPads troubleshooting and downloading apps for classes.
        I set up a tracking system for the chromebooks. Computers were stored in carts and I used colors to
        represent each one. Then I assigned each chromebook with a number.</p>
